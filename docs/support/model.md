The Model
=========

Using spacecraft to work with an address map requires knowing the **model**, as 
you'll either code the model in **[Rocket Fuel][]** or manipulate the model in 
an **engine** with the **[EngineAPI][]**.


Bits
----

Register tools generally map [fields][] into byte, halfword and/or word addresses.
However doing so blends the _functional intent_ of the mapping with the _access 
mechanism_.

Spacecraft, in contrast, maps using **bits**.  Normalizing to bits means that 
you can abstract out the _access mechanism_.  For example<sup>a</sup>: 

<center>313b = 39B.1 = 19H.9 = 9W.25</center>

##### FIGURE 1: Bit normalization #####

Note that all four representations refer to the same bit, so that the 
representations are equivalent; that is the location of the bit _does not depend 
on it's representation_.  Also note however, that the non-bit mappings require 
three quantities to uniquely locate a bit: an integer portion, a fractional 
portion and the unit of measurement.  These three quantities are a function of 
the _access mechanism_ and not the location of the bit.  Normalizing to bits
means only one number is needed and the units are always bits.

<small>
(a) This example uses [Rocket Fuel syntax](/fuel/#bits).
</small>



Spaces
------

A **space** represents an unbounded, indexed array of **[bits][]**.  Bit 0 is on
the right and bit indexes increase to the left<sup>a</sup>:

##### FIGURE 2: A space #####

A space is **empty** or **childless** if no [fields][] or [regions][] are
mapped into it.

<hr class="sc_footnote">
<small>
(a) Bit 0, the least significant bit, is shown on the right to align with the 
    natural language convention that the most significant digit is read first 
    and hence on the left, while the least significant digit is read last and 
    hence on the right. This ensures that octal and hexademical notations, 
    which also follow this ordering convention, map directly into the bit 
    space without any mental gymnastics.
</small>



Fields
------

A **field** is a data structure that maps a **value** to a contiguous set of 
bits.

A field has a **parent**, which is a reference to the [region][] into which 
the field is mapped.

A field has an **offset** into the region of its parent so that the field can be
located and a **size** to indicate how much of the region is occupied.  The offset 
is in units of bits and specifies the least significant (rightmost) bit of the 
field relative to the start of the parent's space.  The **size** of the field is
the number of contiguous bits that make up the field. 

##### FIGURE 3: Field size & offset #####

A field has a **value**, which specifies the initial default value of the bits. 

A field has a **name** so that people can associate the function of the field 
with a memorable identifier.

A field has a **type** which specifies a general class of functionality (i.e. 
configuration or status). 

A field has an optional **description** of the specific function of the bits.

A field has an optional list of user defined **properties**.  See [Properties][]
below for details.

A field may optionally have one or more **dimensions** to compactly represent 
repeated adjacent copies of the field.  See [Dimensions][] below for details. 

A field also has a **filename** and **lineno**, which locate the source of the 
field declaration in the file system (if applicable).


### Field Data Members ###

| Member                   | M/O | Type       | Description                                                                          |
|:-------------------------|:---:|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **parent**               | M   | region*    | A pointer to the region object into which the field is mapped.                       |
| **offset**               | M   | bits       | The offset in bits of the least significant bit of the field.                        |
| **size**                 | M   | bits       | The number of contiguous bits that make up the field.                                |
| **value**                | M   | string     | The initial default value of the bits.                                               |
| **name**                 | M   | string     | The name of the field.                                                               |
| **type**<sup>a<sup>      | M   | string     | The type of the field, which specifies the general functionality of the field.       |
| **description**          | O   | string     | A description of the specific functionality associated with the field.               |
| **properties**           | O   | property*  | A list of user defined [properties][].                                               |
| **dimensions**           | O   | dimension* | An array of [dimensions][].                                                          | 
| **filename**<sup>b</sup> | O   | string     | The name of the file the field was declared in (if applicable).                      |
| **lineno**<sup>b</sup>   | O   | integer    | The line number in the file the field was declared in (if applicable).               |                         

<small>
    M/O = Mandatory/Optional
</small>
<small>
(a) Though the field type is a mandatory data member, **spacecraft has absolutely 
    no type awareness**.  Type information is generally required for most, if not 
    all, engines however, which is why it is mandatory.  The lack of type 
    awareness in spacecraft is actually quite powerful, as it opens the door for
    completely custom field types.
</small>
<small>
(b) If the field is read from a file, the filename and lineno data members will 
    be available.  If the field is inserted with the [EngineAPI](../api/), 
    filename and lineno data members will be available if they were provided 
    (typically using the  `__FILE__` & `__LINE__` tokens).  Filename and lineno 
    data members are read-only. 
</small>



Regions
-------

A **region** is a data structure that maps **children** into a contiguous set
of bits. 

##### FIGURE 4: A region #####

A **child** is either a field: 

##### FIGURE 5: A region with a mapped field ##### 

Or another, smaller region: 
 
##### FIGURE 6: A region with a mapped region ##### 

Because a region can contain other regions, they add hierarchy to the mapping.
From the perspective of the parent region in Figure 6, the child region
_occupies_ or _reserves_ a contiguous set of bits in its space.  From this 
perspective, a region is very much like a field.  From the perspective of the 
child region in Figure 6, however, the child region _provides_ a smaller space 
into which more children can be mapped. The space provided is finite and is 
equivalent to the size occupied in the parent.

Because a child can either be a field or a region, fields and regions are 
collectively called mapped **nodes**. 

##### FIGURE 7: A child region with mapped fields #####

##### FIGURE 8: A hierarchy of regions & fields #####

There are a couple of things to note about the children of a region.  The first 
is that they are entirely contained within the space of the parent â€“ a child 
cannot extend past the finite end of the parent region.  The implication here 
is that all nodes mapped into the region are no bigger than the **size** of the
region. The second is that children are adjacent, not necessarily contiguous, 
and never overlap. 

A **region** has zero or more children. A region is **childless** if it has no
children.

A region has a **parent**, which is a reference to the [region][] into which 
this region is mapped.

A region has an **offset** into the space of its parent so that the region can be 
located and a **size** to indicate how much of the bit space is occupied.  The 
**offset** is in units of bits and specifies the least significant (rightmost) 
bit of the region relative to the start of the parent's space.  The **size** of 
the region is the number of contiguous bits that make up the region.

##### FIGURE 9: Region size & offset #####

A region has a **glob**, which is a rule that specifies how the names of children 
are altered (if at all) when they are imported into the region.  See
[Addresses, Identifiers and Spaces](#addresses-identifiers-and-spaces) below
for details. 

A region has an optional **name**.  If a region does not have a name then it is 
an **anonymous** or **unnamed** region.

A region has an optional **type** so that it can be mapped as a child multiple 
times with different names and different offsets.  If a region does not have a 
type then it is a **typeless** or **untyped** region.

A region has an optional **description** of the specific nature of the region.

A region may optionally have one or more **dimensions** to compactly represent 
repeated adjacent copies of the region.  See [Dimensions][] below for details. 

A region has an optional list of user defined **properties**.  See [Properties][] 
below for details.

A region also has a **filename** and **lineno**, which locate the source of the
region declaration in the file system (if applicable).

a) A region either has a **parent** or it is a **space**.
</small>
<small>
b) The **glob** is mandatory and must contain an asterisk character (`*`) to 
   represent a how the names of children are prefixed and suffixed when they are
   imported into the space.  The prefix is the string before the asterisk while 
   the suffix is the string after it, either or both of which may be absent.
   If the glob consists of only the asterisk character then the names of 
   children are unaltered when they are imported.
</small>
<small>
c) Because a child can either be a field or a region, fields and regions are 
  collectively called nodes.
</small>
<small>
d) If the region is read from a file, the filename and lineno data members will 
   be available.  If the region is inserted with the [Engine API](/api/), 
   filename and lineno data members will be available if they were provided 
   (typically using the  `__FILE__` & `__LINE__` tokens).  Filename and lineno 
   data members are read-only. 
</small>

### Addresses, Identifiers and Spaces ###

Because of the hierarchical nature of regions, there is be a region at the top 
of the hierarchy.  This region is special because it is an anonymous region with
no **parent** or **offset** and infinite **size**. In fact it is the **space** 
into which all fields are mapped, either directly or through the hierarchy of 
regions.

Note that this effectively defines a concrete data structure for an otherwise 
abstract concept:

A **space** is an anonymous **region** (data structure) with no **parent** or 
**offset** and infinite **size** that represents an unbounded, indexed array 
of **[bits][]**.

Ultimately all nodes relate back to the space, as this is the point of mapping 
them.

The **address** of an item is its offset relative to the space, not its parent.
The address of a mapped item is constructed by summing its offset with the 
offsets of each intervening region:
 
##### FIGURE 10: Address construction ##### 

The **identifier** of an item is its name when imported into the space.  The 
identifier of a mapped item is constructed by prefixing and suffixing its name 
with the globs of each intervening region:

##### FIGURE 11: Identifier construction #####



Properties
----------

Every field or region may have a set of optional user defined **properties**.
Properties are key/value pairs where the **key** is a string and the **value** 
is either a string or absent, making the key a existance/non-existance boolean.

Properties are intended for altering the behavior of a specific engine for the 
given field or region. **Spacecraft has no awareness of what a given property 
may do**; it simply annotates the item with the property for retrieval through 
the [Engine API][].

Since properties are generally targetted to a particular engine, it is 
recommended that the key be prefixed the name of the engine.

### Property Data Members ###

| Member    | M/O | Type   |  Description                                                                                            |
|:----------|:---:|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **value** | O   | string | Stores arbitrary data relevant to the property if more than simple existence/non-existence is required. |

<small>
M/O = Mandatory/Optional
</small>



Dimensions
----------

Dimensions are a compact way of representing **adjacent repeated copies** of a 
mapped item.

##### FIGURE 12: A dimensioned field #####

The copies of the mapped item are indexed sequentially and range from **from** 
to **to**.  The original mapped item is always numbered **from**.

If **from** < **to**, copy indexing sequentially increases as copy offset 
increases:

##### FIGURE 13: Sequentially increasing indexing #####

If **from** > **to**, copy indexing sequentially decreases as copy offset 
increases: 

##### FIGURE 14: Sequentially decreasing indexing #####

A dimension has a **label** that is used to represent an arbitrary, unspecified
or variable copy. 

A dimension has a **size** that specifies the number of contiguous bits that a 
copy occupies.  The dimension size is distinct from the item size to allow for 
different packing schemes.

For example, consider the case of a repeated 7 bit field.  Without a distinct 
dimension size the copies would rotate through byte alignment:

##### FIGURE 15: Misaligned copy packing #####

With a dimension size of 8, however, the repeated 7 bit field can be packed with
byte alignment: 

##### FIGURE 16: Aligned copy packing #####

The dimension size must be greater than or equal to the item size and "snaps" to
the item size if it is unspecified. 

The **count** of a dimension is the total number of copies:

<center><b>count</b> = |<b>from</b> â€“ <b>to</b>| + 1</center>

The **span** of a dimension is the total space consumed by all copies:

<center><b>span</b> = <b>count</b> * <b>size</b></center>


##### FIGURE 17: Dimension span #####

A mapped item can have one or more dimensions.  The first dimension is the 
innermost.  The second dimension is the next innermost and snaps to span of the 
first dimension if a size is unspecified. Similarly, subsequent higher dimensions 
snap to the span of the next lower dimension when size is unspecified so that 
tightly packed nested copies can be easily constructed: 

##### FIGURE 18: A multi-dimensional field #####

Note that the span of a dimensioned item, not its size, must be considered when 
mapping the offset of the next item.

A mapped item with zero dimensions is **dimensionless**.

### Dimension Data Members ###

| Member     | M/O           | Type    | Description                                                                     |
|:-----------|:-------------:|:--------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **label**  | M             | string  | A name for the set of indices.                                                  |
| **from**   | M             | integer | The index of the first copy.                                                    |
| **to**     | M             | integer | The index of the last copy.                                                     |
| **size**   | M<sup>a</sup> | bits    | The number of bits occupied by a single copy.                                   |
| **count**  | M<sup>b</sup> | integer | The number of copies; equivalent to \|**from**-**to**\|+1.                      |
| **span**   | M<sup>b</sup> | bits    | The number of bits occupied by all copies, equivalent to **size** * **count**.  |

<small>
M/O = Mandatory/Optional 
</small>
<small>
a) The size of a dimension is mandatory but will snap to the size of the next 
   lower dimension or the item size when no lower dimension if no size is 
   specified.
</small>
<small>
b) The count and span are computed data members and not stored so as to keep 
   them consistent with the from, to and size data members. 
</small>

Dimensions for an item, if present, are stored in an indexed array where 
dimension 1 is the innermost (rightmost) and dimension N the outermost (leftmost).


###  Rolled vs Unrolled Representation ###

In a **rolled** representation, there is only a single instance of the mapped 
item and dimension information for that item is stored as an array of dimension
stuctures.

##### FIGURE 19: Rolled representation #####

In an **unrolled** representation, adjacent copies have been elaborated and 
exist as distinct instances _as if they had been declared that way_.  All copies, 
including the original, are dimensionless.

##### FIGURE 20: Unrolled representation #####

Note that in either representation, the same number of bits have been consumed 
in the parent region.
